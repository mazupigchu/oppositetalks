            When your relation with the person is strong and deep, you sometimes tend to expect things without asking for them or talking about them. In the same way, when you end up saying the opposite of what you mean, is when you just want the other person to understand what you want to say without you actually saying it. It's more like checking if that person knows you well enough to judge that you actually mean the opposite of what you are saying.  </p>   
            <p>
            Expressing contrary to what one actually mean is one of the causes of communication errors and misunderstandings in intimate relationships. The purpose of this website is to provide a "book of answers", a playful tool for people who are struggling with opposite talks.</p>
